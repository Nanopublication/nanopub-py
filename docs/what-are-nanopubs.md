# What are nanopublications?
Nanopublications are a formalized and machine-readable way of communicating the smallest possible units
of publishable information. This could be, for example, the outcome of a scientific study or a claim
made by a particular scientist.

Nanopublications are searchable, citable, and contain authorship and attribution
information. The aim is to encourage individual scientific results to be released in a traceable and
interoperable format. As such, nanopublications are an effective [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
means of communicating scientific claims and results. Read more about them at [http://nanopub.org/](http://nanopub.org/).
