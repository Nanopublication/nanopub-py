## üì• Install for development

Clone the repository and go in the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-py
cd nanopub
```

To install the project for development you can use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/).

If you don't have it installed, first install it following the
official [installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Once poetry is installed, you can install all the project dependencies by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

Optionally, install `pre-commit` to enable automated formatting and linting of the code at each commit:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development workflow

Try to sign a nanopublication with the code defined in `scripts/dev.py` to test your changes:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

The code will be automatically formatted when you commit your changes using `pre-commit`. But you can also run the
script to format the code yourself:

```bash
./scripts/format.sh
```

Check the code for errors, and if it is in accordance with the PEP8 style guide, by running `flake8` and `mypy`:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh
```

## ‚úÖ Run the tests

Tests are automatically run by a GitHub Actions workflow when new code is pushed to the GitHub repository.

The tests use the [```nanopub-java```](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-java) tool for validating the signing
process implemented in python produces similar nanopublications. This is automatically installed by the library, just
make sure `java` is available where you run the tests.

=== "bash"

	Run the tests locally:

	```bash
	./scripts/test.sh
	```

	You can also run only a specific test:

	```bash
	./scripts/test.sh tests/test_nanopub.py::test_nanopub_sign_uri
	```

=== "poetry"

	Run the tests locally:

	```bash
	poetry run pytest
	```

	You can also run only a specific test:

	```bash
	poetry run pytest tests/test_nanopub.py::test_nanopub_sign_uri
	```

## üìñ Generate docs

[![Publish docs](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-py/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-py/actions/workflows/build.yml){:
target="_blank"}

The documentation (this website) is automatically generated from the markdown files in the `docs` folder and python
docstring comments, and published by a GitHub Actions workflow.

Serve the docs on [http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008){:target="_blank"}

=== "bash"

    ```bash
    ./scripts/docs.sh
    ```

=== "poetry"

    ```bash
    poetry run mkdocs serve
    ```

## üè∑Ô∏è Publish a new release

[![Publish to PyPI](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-py/actions/workflows/pypi.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-py/actions/workflows/pypi.yml){:

The release are automatically triggered using the `semantic-release` plugin together with conventional commits.
